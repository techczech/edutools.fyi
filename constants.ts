# Vibecoding for Educators: Explaining Difficult Concepts with Apps

This is a guide for a workshop at the AI in Education Conference at Cambridge 2025.

**Abstract:**
AI-assisted coding is a major driver in the generative AI industry with clear benefits. This workshop explores its potential impact on education. By the end, participants will have built an education app with AI using Gemini and Google AI Studio, exploring new pedagogies and learning impacts.

## What to learn
You will learn to make simple applications with AI tools, such as a word frequency analyzer. This is taught at four levels, from simple HTML files to AI-powered apps.

## What to do
Try making simple apps like a word-to-number converter in English and French or a task tracker.

### Task 1: Generate code as an HTML file
- Use any chatbot (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Qwen Chat).
- Prompt it to write code you can run in a single browser file.
- Save the code as an .html file and open it.

### Task 2: Use a chatbot with Canvas/Artifacts
- Use a chatbot with a Canvas or Artifact feature (Claude, Gemini, Qwen Chat).
- Describe the application you want to build.

### Task 3: Use an agentic app builder
- Use a tool like Lovable, DeepSite, Replit, V0, or Bolt.
- Describe the application and use the deployment feature to make it live.

### Task 4: Deploying an AI-powered app
- Create an app with features only an LLM can provide (e.g., answering questions).
- This requires a server and API access.
- Google AI Studio (ai.dev) is recommended for getting started for free.

## Building LLM-powered applications
This is about building applications that are themselves powered by LLMs.

**Key things to learn:**
1.  Why apps need LLM power (difference between "if/then" and "I get it" processing).
2.  Components of LLM-powered apps (interface, backend, API access, prompts).
3.  Knowledge needed (choosing models, prompting, working with APIs).
4.  Where to learn more.

## Tools Used
- **Google AI Studio (ai.dev):** For building/deploying simple AI apps and getting a free API key.
- **Google Colab:** Online programming notebook for experiments.
- **OpenRouter:** Source for API keys to various LLMs.
- **Dify.ai:** Tool for building complex orchestrations.

## Activities
1.  **Explore limits of logic:** Compare rule-based chatbots with LLM-powered ones.
2.  **Build a simple chatbot in Google AI Studio:** Use a simple prompt like "Make a simple chatbot powered by Gemini."
3.  **Explore how APIs work in Google Colab:** Get an API key from Google AI Studio and use it in a Colab notebook.
4.  **Create a system prompt in Google AI Studio:** Experiment with system instructions to control chatbot behavior.

## Next steps and learning sources
- Learn about choosing models from the OpenRouter leaderboard.
- Learn complex orchestrations on Dify.ai.
- Learn more about AI Engineering from resources like the AI Engineer YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@aiDotEngineer and an intro video: https://youtu.be/PSWUr5E_OKY?si=k0129mDvAu058m7o

## What to try
- **Tools:** Try Claude with Artifacts, Gemini with Canvas, Google AI Studio, Lovable.dev, Replit.
- **Ideas:** Think of a visualization or simulation tool in your area of expertise, or a use of an LLM’s semantic power in an app.
